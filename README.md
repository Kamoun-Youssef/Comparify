#Image Comparator | OpenCV

A simple/dumb C++ based image comparator.

The project is mainly four parts

  - C++ code: gets 2 image paths as input return similarity
  - PHP script that would handle user inputs and looking for the images on the server. (Don't ask why it isn't C++, I don't know)
  - JS: Browser-side scripts to handle user inputs and the display of the image gallery and stats.
  - Magic ! 

PS: 
* Note that in order for *THIS* code to work you'll need a dirctory `dataset` that contains the images to be compared.
* The scripts are fare form optimisation. For a gallery of 805 images, the average run time I acheaved on my laptop is aroudn 7seconds.
